# Conda Installation

## Install Conda to make a virtual environment for managing the tools

**PLEASE BE REMINDED TO TICK THE ADD TO ENV PATH OPTION For Windows**

- Go to Anaconda [installation website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success) and install conda via installers. Both Conda and Miniconda are acceptable.
  - Check **ON** the Red Box "Add installation to my PATH" option during installation:
  - You may also want to check on the green box, if you prefer to use Conda in text editor like VSCode.

  It means your enviroment lacks some essential tools/compilers for building the packages we want to install. Usually conda install python would solve these kind of problems
  ```bash
  conda install python==x.xx.x # x.xx.x means the python version you want to install
  # in this workshop we use python 3.10
  conda install python==3.10
  ```
